# My dockerfiles

The `*.dockerfile` files in this directory are some very basic Dockerfiles to just give a basic image to play around in (for example, `perlbase` and `pybase` are mainly used for their REPLs) and were created before I got heavily in to doing VS Code devcontainers. (These would still work with a `devcontainer.json` file; see [Using Images, Dockerfiles, and Docker Compose](https://containers.dev/guide/dockerfile)).

The comments at the top of each `*.dockerfile` file details how I generally used the dockerfile. These are notes for myself and (obviously) you don't have to follow them. Additionally, if referring to one of them from a `devcontainer.json` file, you wouldn't need to worry about those usage suggestions at all.
