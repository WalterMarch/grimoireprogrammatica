# devcontainers README

A place to keep information about devcontainers I've used.

External starting points include
* [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
* [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/)

For the complete structure of a file `devcontainer.json` file, take a look at [the one for this repository](../.devcontainer/devcontainer.json).
